1. PVP is allowed. Don't Combat log!
2. Don't be *overly* cruel, destructive, or inappropriate.
3. Keep swearing to a minimum, and don't spam.
4. No "Dating" or the like.
5. Don't clear out entire forests. replant!
6. If you raid a kingdom while it's members are offline, only take small amounts of loot.
